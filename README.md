 # The Idea
 Hello everyone who watch this repo, I always wanted to build something that will
 make it easier to build and use html-templates with Flask. 
 new to flask? firstly go read some official doc.
 I attched the template here to the project, to make it easier to use while fork.
 I need everything to be automated and clean.. Lets do it :)

# Every contribute will help

# - Some Points:
1.
 + The app has been coded to listen on port 5000
 + the generator will build the app.py as templates for you to edit and for saving time,
 + it excpects you to take a look and review the solution.

2.
 + The code ignore generate header.html in app.py, 
 + so that if your template has a file called header.html you need to change here and in json the configuration (local change obviously)

3.
 + App.py accepting POST and GET requests, consider that.

4.
 + Title will be generic, if you want to change it you need to go over header.html and edit it.
